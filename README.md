# C#Securityüõ°Ô∏è

**About this project**
---

A simple antivirus application using C# with WPF created for my university project in security.

**Project Scope**
---

**Objective:**
Develop a basic antivirus software capable of locating and identifying specific files within a computer system.
**Description:**
I have been tasked with creating a simple antivirus software as an integral component of an educational project. The primary objective of the software is to locate specific files within the system and report their presence.

**Software Requirements:**

1. **Graphical Interface (optional):** The software may feature a simple graphical interface or operate through the command line.
2. **File Search:** The antivirus should be proficient in searching for specific files in the system, particularly those with the extensions *.exe and *.bat.
3. **Results Report:** The software must generate a report listing the identified files, providing the complete path for each file.
4. **Removal Option (optional):** The antivirus may include an option to remove the identified files. While this feature is optional, its implementation, if chosen, should be approached with caution to prevent inadvertent deletion of essential system files.
